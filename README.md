Estimates suggest that accurate occupancy detection in buildings can lead to substantial energy savings ranging from 30% to 42%. 
The objective of this assignment is to leverage a dataset comprising information gathered from light, temperature, humidity, and CO2 sensors to achieve precise occupancy detection in buildings. 
By employing specific algorithms, our aim is to identify optimal conditions for accurately determining occupancy status. 
This endeavor is driven by the potential to significantly reduce energy consumption through informed occupancy-based control strategies.
